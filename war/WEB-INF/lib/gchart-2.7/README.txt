What's in the gchart-x.x.zip:

o The gchart.jar is in the root folder of the zip. If you
  don't need to access the javadocs off-line, you can just grab
  this and follow the instructions at http://gchart.googlecode.com

o All Client-side GChart documentation, including sample code and
  screen shots, is in the javadocs. 
  If you want to access these javadocs off-line  
  you should unzip the gchart-x.x.zip file into a folder of 
  your choice (e.g. c:\gchart) Then you can open the
  javadocs by opening index.html in the javadoc folder
  (e.g. c:\gchart\javadoc\index.html).

See the javadoc for full installation instructions, a "Chart
Gallery" of sample code and screen shots, and, of course,
detailed Client-side GChart API specs.

For human assistance, simply post an issue on the GChart issue tracker.
Don't worry if it's not a traditional bug/new feature issue request.
I've decided to just use the issue tracker as a forum, too, so you
have less places to search for stuff, and I have less stuff to
maintain.

Thanks for using Client-side GChart. Please consider helping with
the project. Even simple bug reports or feature requests have
started things that eventually had a big impact on the product.
If you have a successful GChart application with a public URL,
please share it so others can see how the product helped you. All
contributions, conceptual or practical, pseudo or fully coded,
gratefully acknowledged and properly documented.
