/**
 * A class for storing and sending around the results from a query, that asks

 * 
 * <p>Count data keeps track of a number of groups. For each group, it stores
 * how many subjects have given a specific answer.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In this, the comparative version of the count class, each group contains
 * two data sets. The primary data set and the secondary.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An example of how the data is represented in the arrays returned by the
 * class:<br /> If we have a question with three answers (A, B, C). In our group
 * 3 people answered A, 42 people answered B and 9 people answered C. The count
 * data would be stored as [3, 42, 9]</p>
 * 
 * <p>Comparative count data can be used to display a {@link BarChartCompare}
 * .</p>
 * 
 * <p> For more information about the basics of query results, see
